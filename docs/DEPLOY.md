# Deploying the marketplace

The marketplace is a standard Laravel 13 application. It runs on any host
with PHP 8.3+ and **MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+**. It has its own database
and shares nothing with merchant stores. Stores talk to it over HTTPS.

PHP extensions: `ctype`, `curl`, `fileinfo`, `mbstring`, `openssl`,
`pdo_mysql`, `tokenizer`, `xml` and `zip`. `sodium` is used when present;
otherwise the bundled `paragonie/sodium_compat` does the signing.

Set PHP `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` large enough for your
uploads: package ZIPs may be up to 20 MB, core release ZIPs up to 200 MB
(`256M` and `260M` cover both). `public/.user.ini` sets these on hosts that
read it (PHP-FPM, LiteSpeed, most cPanel servers); elsewhere set them in the
hosting panel's PHP settings (cPanel: MultiPHP INI Editor or Select PHP
Version → Options). Admin → Core releases shows the limit the server
actually applies. A request over the limit gets a "file is too large" page
(HTTP 413).

## Shared hosting (cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin)

1. **Database.** In the control panel, create a MySQL (or MariaDB) database
   and a user with all privileges on it. Note the host (usually
   `localhost`), database name, user and password.
2. **Upload.** Run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` on your
   computer (or on the host if it has Composer), then upload the whole
   `marketplace-catalog` folder, including `vendor/`, *outside*
   `public_html`, for example to `/home/you/marketplace`.
3. **Document root.** Point the domain or subdomain (for example
   `marketplace.example.com`) at `/home/you/marketplace/public`. If the panel
   cannot change the document root, make `public_html` a symlink to the
   `public` folder. Never expose the app root: `.env` and `storage/` must not
   be reachable from the web.
4. **Permissions.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (the installer does this
   if it can). `.env`, `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` must be writable by
   PHP.
5. **Web installer.** Open `https://marketplace.example.com`. Until setup is
   done every page leads to `/install`:
   - **Step 1 · Database:** enter the MySQL host, port, database, user and
     password. The installer tests the connection, refuses servers older
     than MySQL 5.7 / MariaDB 10.3, saves the details in `.env` and creates
     the tables.
   - **Step 2 · Admin account:** name, email and a password of 12+
     characters for the first administrator.

   When it finishes, `/install` is closed for good (it answers 404; the lock
   file is `storage/app/installed`). Run the installer right after
   uploading: until it is done, whoever opens the site first can set it up.

   With a terminal you can do the same without the browser: fill the `DB_*`
   values in `.env`, then run `php artisan key:generate`,
   `php artisan migrate --force --seed` and `php artisan marketplace:install`.
6. **Cache (optional).** After setup, `php artisan optimize` caches config,
   routes and views. Do not cache config before the installer has run.
7. **Cron.** Add one cron job that runs every minute:

   ```
   * * * * * cd /home/you/marketplace && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   It sends queued email (license keys after purchase) and removes expired
   download links. Without cron, set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` in `.env` so
   email is sent during the request.
8. **Settings.** Sign in at `/admin/login` and fill in Settings:
   marketplace name and currency, Stripe keys, SMTP. Use **Send a test
   email** to check delivery. Settings → Licensing shows the public key
   stores need.

## VPS (Nginx + PHP-FPM)

Install the app as above (for example in `/var/www/marketplace`, owned by
the PHP-FPM user, with `apt install mysql-server` or `mariadb-server`),
configure Nginx, then open the site to run the installer:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name marketplace.example.com;
    root /var/www/marketplace/public;
    index index.php;
    client_max_body_size 25m;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known) {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Add HTTPS with Certbot (`certbot --nginx -d marketplace.example.com`);
stores send license keys to this server, so always serve it over HTTPS.
The scheduler cron (above) also covers the queue; a busy server can run a
worker under systemd or Supervisor instead
(`php artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3`).

Apache works too: point `DocumentRoot` at `public/`. The bundled
`public/.htaccess` handles the rewrites when `AllowOverride All` is set.

## Stripe

1. In the Stripe dashboard → Developers → API keys, copy the publishable
   and secret keys into Admin → Settings → Payments.
2. Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint:
   `https://marketplace.example.com/stripe/webhook`, events
   `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`,
   `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
   `checkout.session.async_payment_failed` and `charge.refunded`. Copy the signing secret (`whsec_…`) into the same
   settings page.

A paid order is completed by the webhook, not by the browser returning from
Stripe, so the webhook must be reachable from the internet.

## Connecting stores

Admin → Settings → Licensing shows the Ed25519 public key. In each
merchant store's `.env`:

```
ECOMODULAR_MARKETPLACE_URL=https://marketplace.example.com
ECOMODULAR_MARKETPLACE_TRUSTED_KEYS=<public key>
```

Keep any keys already listed (comma separated), then run
`php artisan config:clear` in the store. Customers paste their license key
in the store's Admin → Marketplace page.

## Moving from the old catalog app

The previous catalog app kept everything in `storage/catalog.sqlite`. Copy
that file (and its `storage/` folder, which holds release ZIPs and uploads)
to the server. Import **before the site is public**: until then anyone
could register an old customer's email or run the installer. Skip the web
installer: put the MySQL details in `.env` (`DB_*`) and run, in
maintenance mode:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan down
php artisan migrate --force --seed
php artisan marketplace:import-legacy /path/to/old/storage/catalog.sqlite
php artisan up
```

It copies accounts (passwords keep working), packages, categories, licenses,
store activations, orders, submissions, the logo, uploads and release ZIPs.
The signing key is kept, so stores connected before keep working without a
new trusted key. The old administrators come along, so the import also
closes the web installer; skip `marketplace:install`.

The command prints warnings for anything it could not copy. An email that
already has an account here with a different password is not merged (its
licenses and orders are skipped), and values longer than the new columns are
shortened or dropped.

Running it again adds only what is new. Settings changed in the new admin
(Stripe keys, SMTP, currency, ...) are kept; only settings that do not exist
yet are copied.

## Publishing from the platform repository

`php artisan marketplace:publish vendor/package` zips
`modules/vendor/package` or `themes/vendor/package` from `CATALOG_ROOT`
(default: the folder above this app) and publishes it as a signed release.
A new package is listed as published; an existing listing only gets the new
version.

## Backups

Back up two things, daily:

- the database (`mysqldump`), which holds accounts,
  licenses, orders, settings and the signing key (encrypted with `APP_KEY`);
- `storage/app/private` (or `MARKETPLACE_STORAGE`), which holds release
  ZIPs, submissions, thumbnails and the logo.

Keep a copy of `.env` somewhere safe. Without its `APP_KEY` the stored
secrets (Stripe, SMTP, signing key) cannot be decrypted, and stores would
need a new trusted key.

## Updating the marketplace

Upload the new code (keeping `.env` and `storage/`), then:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan optimize
```
